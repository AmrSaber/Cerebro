\subsection{Preface}
\paragraph{}<You expect employees to have high levels of emotional intelligence when interacting with customers. Now, thanks to advances in Deep Learning, you’ll soon expect your software to do the same.>
\paragraph{}<Companies have also been taking advantage of emotion recognition to drive business outcomes. For the upcoming release of Toy Story 5, Disney plans to use facial recognition to judge the emotional responses of the audience. Apple even released a new feature on the iPhone X called Animoji, where you can get a computer simulated emoji to mimic your facial expressions. It’s not so far off to assume they’ll use those capabilities in other applications soon.>
