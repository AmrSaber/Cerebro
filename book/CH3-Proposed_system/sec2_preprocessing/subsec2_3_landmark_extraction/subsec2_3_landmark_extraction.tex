We choose landmarks of 68 shape predictor point to make feature extraction and we notice that it has a positive effect on performance, so it's considered to be a very valuable feature for Facial Expression Recognition as performance (accuracy) increases , Table \ref{tab:CH3landmarks} shows a comparison between using HOG features,  facial landmarks and  using them together.
\begin{table}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\caption{the effect of landmarks on the accuracy}
		\label{tab:CH3landmarks}
		\begin{tabular}{l|c}
			\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Testing Accuracy}     \\
			\hline
			Only Hog & 87.54\% \\ 
			Only LandMarks & 85.32\%  \\
			Landmarks + HOG & 89.8\% \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}


%after we used it as with HOG only testing accuracy was 87.54\% and when we added our Landmarks model it increased by about 10\% beside it only can achieve 85.32\% without HOG.
