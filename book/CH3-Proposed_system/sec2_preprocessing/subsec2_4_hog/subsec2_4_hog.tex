\paragraph{}
Here it seems that we have a lot of variations but actually we only have to tune block normalization parameter.
\newline
We took the rest configuration from \cite{hog} as it works with hog for facial expression recognition and there is a comparison on it between a lot of variations.
\newline Here is our configuration: \newline
\begin{itemize}
\item Orientation: 8 bins. \item 12X12 pixels per cell. \item 4X4 cells per block.
\end{itemize}

Tuning the normalization parameter was by try and error so we made the pervious configuration fixed and start to change block\_norm parameter during our work with our datasets.
\newline
The best choice here is the highest testing accuracy.

With FER we choose to work with  .\newline
With CK+ we choose to work with  .\newline
With RafD we choose to work with  \textbf{L2-norm}. \newline
