\paragraph{}
the only tuning we needed for HOG was for the normalization parameter which the rest of parameters were taken following a paper\cite{HOG} we found which compared between other different parameters and giave us a conclusion on the best ones.\newline 
our final configuration: \newline
\begin{itemize}
\item Orientation: 8 bins. 
\item 12X12 pixels per cell. 
\item 4X4 cells per block.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Normalization parameter tuning}
we tried different normalization methods on the different datasets we had and chose the one that gave a better result on average.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c|c|c|c }
	  & FER & CK+ & RafD \\ \hline
	 L1-norm & 23.16\% & X & 89.08\% \\  
	 L2-norm & 36.80\% & X & 90.2\% \\
	 L1-sqrt & 38.61\% & X & 89.21\% \\
	 L2-Hys & 38.61\% & X & 88.96\% \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
With FER \textbf{L1-sqrt} and \textbf{L2-Hys} give best result.\newline
With CK+ we choose to work with  .\newline
With RafD we choose to work with  \textbf{L2-norm}. \newline
\paragraph{}
as obvious from the results \textbf{L1-sqrt} and \textbf{L2-Hys} methods tend to show better results on average, but \textbf{L2-Hys} seems to be more effective method.
