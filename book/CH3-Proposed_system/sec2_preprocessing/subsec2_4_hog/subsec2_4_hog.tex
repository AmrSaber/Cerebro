\paragraph{}
To extract HOG features from the input image we used a function provided by \textbf{scikit-image} package in python, as for the parameters we only tuned the normalization method parameter, as for the rest of parameters were taken following a paper\cite{hog} which compared between other different parameters and gave us insights on the best ones to use.\newline 
our final configuration:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Orientation: 8 bins. 
\item 12X12 pixels per cell. 
\item 4X4 cells per block.
\item normalization method L2
\end{itemize}

We also tried hog with sliding window to increase accuracy in case of using FER dataset, it captures more features than normal hog by passing window throughout the whole image and apply hog to pixels but unfortunately we got test accuracy around 45\% so we decided to not use it for the rest datasets.
