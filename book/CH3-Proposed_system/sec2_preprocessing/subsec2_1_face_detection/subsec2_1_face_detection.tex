for the face detection step we had multiple solutions to consider out of them the following ones where most interesting ones.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item LBP classifier
	\item HAAR classifier
	\item DLIB classifier
	\item PCN (Progressive Calibration Network) face detector
\end{enumerate}
table \ref{tab:facedetectors_compared} shows a comparison between the PROS and CONS of those techniques.\newline

in the end we decided to use \textbf{DLIB face detector} as it gave us enough accuracy at an acceptable execution time, 
we couldn't used PCN detector because it was not compatible with python programming, being implemented in c++, we tried the C/python API to make an interface between the two programs so that our python program can use C/C++ dynamic library of PCN but it didn't work out, and since it was too time consuming for our development time we decided not to use it.

		\textbf{Face detector} & \textbf{Pros} & \textbf{Cons}\\ \hline 
		\textbf{LBP classifier} 
		&
		\begin{itemize}
			\item it's very fast and suitable for real time applications 
		\end{itemize}

		& 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item low accuracy specially with small faces within the image.
			\item only works for frontal faces.
		\end{itemize}
		\\ \hline
		
		\textbf{HAAR classifier} 
		& 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item it's quite accurate, (vastly more accurate than LBP).
			\item can even detect small faces
		\end{itemize}
		& 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item it has long execution time (can be over a second or two)
			\item can only work with frontal faces.
		\end{itemize} 
		\\ \hline
		
		\textbf{DLIB classifier}
		& 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item it's very accurate even more than HAAR classifier.
			\item its execution time is not as bad as HAAR classifier.
		\end{itemize}
		& 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item its execution time is not good enough for smooth real time.
			\item can only work with frontal faces.
		\end{itemize}
		\\ \hline
		\textbf{PCN face detector }
		& 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item it has a very high accuracy, can be the best.
			\item small execution time suitable for real time streaming.
		\end{itemize} 
		& 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item it's implemented in C++ making it hard to integrate with python programs.
