\paragraph{}
In this section we will list the working solutions for every type of noise we mentioned before in review chapter(\ref{chapter:review})\newline
\textbf{list of available image enhancements  we deal with :}
\begin{enumerate}
	% \item Square Images.
	% \item Gray Scale images.
	\item Median filter (to remove Salt and Paper Noise).
	\item SharpeningFilter ( to remove blur in input image).
	\item Non-local Means Denoising Algorithm. (to remove Gaussian Noise).
	\item Keras Deblur GAN (to remove Motion Blur. ).
	\item Face Alignment.
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Trade of between Accuracy and speed }
In order to achieve an acceptable accuracy within real-time constraints we only use few of those methods that will produce better results without hindering the execution speed, so in the end we decided to use \textbf{Median filter} and \textbf{Sharpening filter} only as they didn't affect the program speed unlike other techniques like face alignment that were too time consuming.
