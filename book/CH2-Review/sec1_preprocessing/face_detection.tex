the face detection step is an essential step before facial expression recognition, as we must first extract the faces from the image before further used for feature extraction (HOG and landmarks) then it's passed to the model.
\newline
we tried multiple face detection approaches that are discussed below.

\subsubsection{Haar classifier face detector}

\subsubsection{Dlib face detector}

\subsubsection{PCN face detector}
